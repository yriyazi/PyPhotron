Adding support for 12-bit recording.

With a torch.inference_mode(), torch.autocast("cuda", dtype=torch.bfloat16):

Compile OpenCV
  Compile OpenCV with ffmpeg: Change the encoder library to *'H264'
  Compile OpenCV with OpenGL: Use OpenGL backend to show the live feed
  Compile OpenCV with CUDA: Use accellerated calculations
